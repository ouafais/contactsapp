using npm package I created the react app

I will ned to have multiple pages in this app so I used package react-router-dom.

I used a json file as a database

next steps for the app:

- adding the program that can add new contact
  -adding on click of a row in the cntacts list a page with all info of the contact so we can modify or delete contact
